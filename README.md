# Goodreads-Analysis_Code-Lou

In this Data Analysis project, I hope to analyze my own Goodreads user data, downloaded via data request on September 9, 2022. 

This data includes every book I've personally logged since 2009 as "Want to Read", "Read", and the dates associated with each activity. 

I hope by analyzing this data, I can figure out the average time between marking a book as "Want to Read" and "Read", figuring out the average between the two dates. And thus curbing my desire to buy even more books by accepting that the time between obtaining a book and actually reading a book is very very long. 

Relevant packages that need to be installed to run the project: import json, import matplotlib.pyplot, import numpy, import pandas

Which 5+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements: 
    Feature 1: import data from a json file and create Dictionary from data. 
    Feature 2: Remove Null values from data. 
    Feature 3: Use functions to analyze data: number of entries in dictionary, average, 
    Feature 4: create scatterplot showing distribution of dates
    Feature 5: Explain thought process and code in ReadMe.
