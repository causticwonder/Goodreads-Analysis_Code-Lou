# Goodreads-Analysis_Code-Lou

In this Data Analysis project, I hope to analyze my own Goodreads user data, downloaded via data request on September 9, 2022. 
This data includes every book I've personally logged since 2009 as "Want to Read", "Read", and the dates associated with each activity. 
I hope by analyzing this data, I can figure out the average time between marking a book as "Want to Read" and "Read", figuring out the average between the two dates. And thus curbing my desire to buy even more books by accepting that the time between obtaining a book and actually reading a book is very very long. 
Relevant packages that need to be installed to run the project. This can be a requirements.txt, a config.py file, or just commands formatted neatly in markdown on your readme that say “pip install pandas” for example. But you have to specify which packages need to be installed.

Any special instructions are required for the reviewer to run your project. (For example: “run python main.py” from the command line)
